      , where I work on Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. I lead
      development efforts, supervise team members, and drive architectural
      improvements. I've optimized database performance by 200% through SQL
      indexing, refactored legacy code to reduce runtime from 2 hours to under 1
      minute, and automated key business processes using Python and integration
      tools.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      I'm proficient in modern web technologies including React, Next.js,
      TypeScript, and Python. I have experience managing cloud infrastructure on
      Microsoft Azure, working with SQL Server databases, and implementing
      business process automation. I'm committed to writing clean, maintainable
      code and sharing knowledge with my team through documentation and
      mentorship.

    <p>
      Beyond work, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to
      open-source projects, or enjoying the Buenos Aires tech community.
